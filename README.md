# Work Day Scheduler 

## Purpose 
Provide myself with a daily calendar to see what I need to achieve and where I am at in the day

## Problems Solved 
Time is such a tricky thing. Getting the correct classes to add to a timeblock when you are in the PM was difficult. To solve this problem I changed my class ID's, my array of class id's, and the time I was calling from momentJS into military time or 24hr clock. This made class implementation much easier. 

## Lessons Learend 
How to use JQuery to access elements and using the sibling/parent relationship.
